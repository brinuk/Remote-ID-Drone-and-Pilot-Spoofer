Remote ID Drone and Pilot Spoofer

Detects your location with a GPS module and spawns 16 fake drones and 16 fake pilots around your location.

Built on the work by JJShoots/RemoteIDSpoofer to which I added my GPS decoder library.

Uses a Wemos R2 arduino type board and a BN220 GPS module.
Connections for the Wemos R2 to BN220 are shown in the arduino sketch code

Use the OpenDroneID app on your phone, available on the App Store or Play Store, you'll have to disable WIFI scan throttling for your device,
